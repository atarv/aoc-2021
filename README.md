# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code
2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles.

I've written the programs as Stack scripts so you'll have to have
[Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install)
installed to run them. Running the programs is simple: `./01-1/Main.hs
inputfile.txt`
