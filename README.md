# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code
2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles (not all but most of them).

The programs are written as Stack scripts so you'll have to have
[Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install)
installed to run them. Running the programs is simple: `./Day01Part1.hs
inputfile.txt`
